# Validate_ComBat
This is the Code for our paper "Validation of cross-sectional and longitudinal ComBat harmonization methods for magnetic resonance imaging data on a travelling subject cohort"

The code should be run as follows:
1. Cross-sectional_analysis.R
2. Longitudinal_analysis.R
3. False_positive_rate_figure.R

These scripts will pull in the relevant functions contained in the other files, ending in funs.R.
